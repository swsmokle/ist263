        Hi, my name is Sabrina Smokler. I am sophomore majoring in Innovation, society, and technology, with a peak interest in UX design and how society impacts the modern digital age. In the last year I’ve become heavily involved with the NEXUS club in the iSchool, building new technological innovations, and was appointed Head of Communications for this year. I am a very collaborative person and thrive in a creative environment. I enjoy playing sports and am on the club frisbee team here at Syracuse. My competitiveness in sports and in life stemmed from growing up with 2 brothers, who I thank for giving me thick skin. I am strong believer in anything can be achieved through hard work and perseverance. I love sushi and have been recently into podcasts ranging from TedTalks to pop culture drama. I hope this gives you somewhat of a glimpse of who I am!
